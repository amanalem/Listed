## Challenges
* It took me a very long time to understand CRUD, but I finally understood it at the end. I will continue to work on this app in my free time.

## Successes
* I'm especially proud of how I set up the big listitem creation to include a hidden priority. All bit items have 2 priorities. One will stay the same so you know what category they started in and eventually the other will change to keep track of how long they have been in the list.
